<ul>
<li>Bank handles large volumes of cheques in the clearing process. The process involves many  technical verifications including signature verification. Some of these steps are manual and require human intervention to complete the process. The current process requires the high human capital deployment and longer processing time.</li> 
<li>To resolve above problem, we are creating Automated Cheque Processing feature in Mobile / Web Application with the help of deep learning techniques.</li>
<li>In order to produce a successful cheque processing system, many sub-problems have to be solved such as background and noise removal, recognition of the immense styles of handwriting and signatures, touching and overlapping data in various fields of information and errors in the recognition techniques. In the proposed system we will consider only courtesy Payee Name Recognition, Account Holder Name Recognition, Date Validation, Amount Recognition, Signature Verification and Cheque Classification whether the Cheque is Cancelled or Empty.</li>
